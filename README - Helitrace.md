# settings/configurables
Most easy to configure constants like render resolution or render settings can be configured inside the ".\template\common.h" file

This includes an *ILO* mode which sets up the 256x212 res, enables stochastic fresnel and reduces some volumetrics accuracy so the project definetely runs at the minimum fps on most systems.
